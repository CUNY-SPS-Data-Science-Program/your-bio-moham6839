Hi everyone!

My name is Mohamed Hassan-El Serafi. I don't have a preferred name, but most people call me Mo. 
The best way to contact me is via email, mohamed.hassan181@spsmail.cuny.edu, or moe6839@gmail.com. 
I'm currently a Train Operator for the City of New York. I would say I'm proficient in Python and R, 
with a basic knowledge of SQL. I've used Python for about two years, and R for a year, and completed a 
Coursera course for SQL. I don't have any experience using Javascript. With all the programming languages 
I've learned up to this point, I feel like I'm still learning the nuances for each, and just trying to expand 
my knowledge as much as I can. Besides a quick Google search of the topic, I don't have any prior knowledge 
or experience with a Geographic Information System, but I'm excited to learn more of it. My future career 
objectives are to learn and develop Data Science skills and knowledge from this program and apply it 
in a sports or public policy capacity. Presently, however, I just want any type of real-world experience. 
I'm hoping to learn from this course appropriate visualization techniques as well as knowledge of visualization tools, 
and being able to concisely communicate my findings to an audience. Additionally, I would like to learn the improper 
visualization methods that are used, which can cause misinterpretation and confusion, 
and learn to avoid those practices. Above all, I'm just excited to be part of a learning environment.
